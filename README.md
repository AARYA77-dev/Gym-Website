## Gym Website 🏋️‍♂️

This is a frontend-only Gym Website created as a practice project to improve web development skills and explore modern UI design.

The website showcases a clean, responsive layout with sections like Home, About, Services, and Contact, representing a typical fitness center landing page.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or Next.js/React, if you used them), this project focuses purely on frontend design and styling — no backend functionality is included.
